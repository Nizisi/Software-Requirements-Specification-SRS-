# Software-Requirements-Specification-SRS-
The software requirements specification (SRS) is a specification for a particular software product, program, or set of programs that performs certain functions in a specific environment. The SRS may be written by one or more representatives of the supplier, one or more representatives of the acquirer, or by both. 

It is important to consider the part that the SRS plays in the total project plan. The software may contain essentially all the functionality of the project or it may be part of a larger system. In the latter case typically there will be a requirement specification that will state the interfaces between the system and its software portion, and will place external performance and functionality requirements upon the software portion. Of course the SRS should then agree with and expand upon these system requirements. The SRS indicates the precedence and criticality of requirements. The SRS defines all of the required capabilities of the specified software product to which it applies, as well as documenting the conditions and constraints under which the software has to perform, and the intended verification approaches for the requirements
